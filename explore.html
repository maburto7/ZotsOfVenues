          <h2> Inspiration</h2>
          <p>
            We aimed to share our passion for music and the arts with the incorporation of technological components. There's a common misconception that live performances occur only at large venues or large cities. Similarly, when visiting a new city, one may struggle to discover local events and performances to enjoy.
          </p>
          <p2><b>
              This is where we decided to come in! </p2></b>
          <p>
            By combining multiple tools, we generated a creative platform that locates all venues and their events based on the city searched to uncover events to be enjoyed by all!
